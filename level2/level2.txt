JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
It's basically what how you choose to solve optional choices.
Like: tabs/space, single/double quotes, space between operators etc.
Choose to use squirrely brackets, even if you don't have to.
It may seem insignificant, but it may cause poor readability and messy if not taken seriously.
Eventually you develop a habit/code style.

2. What is a Regular Expression?
It's a "validation language".
You can use it for things like searching and validation of a text/string.
It has different character classes like \s for whitespace and \d for digits(there's a list of different ones).
As I went through the regex course, I understood how powerful it can be.

3. What does the .random() method do?
It's used to output a random number, used with Math.random().
Math.random() returns a random number between 0, and 1.
It's mostly used with Math.floor, since the combination returns whole numbers.

4. What does the .sort() method do?
It's used with arrays, compares data and sorts in alphabetical order(strings) or in chronological (numbers).

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
It does the opposite of .sort().

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
for(let i=0;i<a.length;i = i+1){//do something}
// Poor readability

if (this value == something) {
  do this
}
// You should use === when validation equality.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?
strings(double quotes), numbers, objects(JSON), array, boolean, null

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?
It's when you remove excess whitespace, new lines and tabs.
It reduces filesize, which makes load time quicker.


9. What is a global variable?
It's a variable that can be accessed from anywhere in the script.
a variable in a function block, is NOT a global variable.
